@MultipleTasks
Feature: End-to-end testing
  As a user
  I want to perform multiple tasks
  So that I can confirm that Playwright is a suitable testing tool

Scenario: User views freezing weather forecasts and repeatedly increments the counter
	Given the user wants to validate Playwrights performance
	When they take lots of different actions
	Then they can confirm that execution time is low
